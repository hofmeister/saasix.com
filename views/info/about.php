        <h2>What?</h2>
        <p>
            SaaSix is an attempt at indexing all the cloud applications, services and technologies online in a single place.
            It is completly non-profit and has the sole purpose of connecting users with the available applications that are out there.

        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p> 
            We created SaaSix because we needed it ourselves. With so many talented companies busting out impressive technologies online at increasing 
            speed, keeping track of the tools you might need has become harder and harder. 
        </p>
        <p>    
            Moreover - web applications themselves are usually not very SEO friendly so google might not show you the best and brightest, as it's often hard
            to formulate search terms that provides you with exactly what you need.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thirdly - you might not even know that you need it - untill you know it exists :)
